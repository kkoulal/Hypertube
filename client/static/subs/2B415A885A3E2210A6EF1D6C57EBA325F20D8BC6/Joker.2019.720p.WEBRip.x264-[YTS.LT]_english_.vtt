[Arthur sniffles]

99
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:53.859
Is it just me,

100
00:04:53.925 --> 00:04:56.529
or is it getting
crazier out there?

101
00:04:59.998 --> 00:05:03.436
- It is certainly tense.
- Hmm.

102
00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:05.238
People are upset.

103
00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:08.474
They're struggling.
Looking for work.

104
00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:09.841
These are tough times.

[exhales]

106
00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.380
How about you?

107
00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:18.151
Have you been keeping
up with your journal?

108
00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:21.587
Yes, ma'am.

109
00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:25.191
Great.

110
00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:27.093
Did you bring it
with you?

111
00:05:31.564 --> 00:05:32.998
Arthur.

112
00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:35.034
Last time,
I asked you to bring your journal

113
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.537
with you
for these appointments.

114
00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:39.072
Can I see it?

115
00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.952
I've been using it as a journal,

116
00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:58.224
but also
as a joke diary.

117
00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:01.993
Funny thoughts
or observations.

118
00:06:02.894 --> 00:06:04.330
I think
I told you

119
00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:07.433
I'm pursuing a career
in stand-up comedy.

120
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.472
No, you didn't.

121
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.042
I think I did.

more sense than my life."

[laughs]

124
00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.773
How does it feel to
have to come here?

125
00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:50.042
Does it help to have
someone to talk to?

126
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.114
I think
I felt better

127
00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:57.350
when I was locked
up in the hospital.

128
00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:00.586
And have you
thought more about

129
00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:03.790
why you were
locked up?

130

[head thudding]

131
00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:10.996
Who knows?

132
00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:19.739
I was wondering if you
could ask the doctor

133
00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:21.940
to increase
my medication.

134
00:07:27.313 --> 00:07:31.217
Arthur, you're on
seven different medications.

135
00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:34.153
Surely,
they must be doing something.

136
00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:39.725
I just don't want to
feel so bad anymore.

Would you please
stop bothering my kid?

140
00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:22.068
I wasn't bothering him.
I was...

141
00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:23.503
Just stop.

142

[Arthur laughing]

143
00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:33.779
What?
You think that's funny?

[Penny] Happy,
did you check the mail

153
00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:43.110
before you came up?

154
00:10:43.175 --> 00:10:44.844
Yeah, Mom.

155
00:10:45.745 --> 00:10:47.413
Nothing.

Yeah.

He's a busy man.

166

Please. I worked for
that family for years.

167
00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:15.341
The least he could do
is write back.

Here. Don't get all worked up.
Eat.

Hi, Murray. Arthur.

Oh, okay. Well,
there's something special about you,

Arthur, I could tell.

Where are you from?

00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:32.578
I live right here

- with my [stammers] mother.
- [audience laughing]

[Murray] Okay, hold on. Hold on.

224
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:38.717
There's nothing funny
about that.

225
00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:40.820
I lived with my mother before I made it.
Just me and her.

226
00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:43.789
I'm that kid whose father went
out for a pack of cigarettes,

227
00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:45.058
and he never
came back.

[audience] Aww.

229
00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:48.094
[Arthur] I know
what that's like, Murray.

230
00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:50.863
I've been the man of the house
for as long as I can remember.

231
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:52.932
I take good care
of my mother.

232

All that sacrifice,
she must love you very much.

233
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.807
She does.

234
00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:05.778
She always tells me to smile
and put on a happy face.

235
00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.547
She says I was put here to
spread joy and laughter.

Wow.

238
00:14:16.089 --> 00:14:18.958
I like that. I like that a lot.
Come on down.

239

We'll be right back.

00:14:52.691 --> 00:14:54.194
That was great, Arthur.
Thank you.

247
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:56.229
I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say.

248
00:14:56.296 --> 00:14:57.529
It made my day.

249
00:14:57.596 --> 00:14:59.032
Thanks, Murray.

00:14:59.099 --> 00:15:00.833
You see all this,
the lights, the show,

251

the audience,
all that stuff?

252
00:15:02.468 --> 00:15:03.602
I'd give it all up
in a heartbeat

253
00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:05.005
to have a kid
like you.

258

Another day

[man] Yup.

You okay?

261
00:15:58.857 --> 00:16:01.660
I heard about
the beatdown you took.

Fucking savages.

263
00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:07.300
It was just a bunch of kids.
I should have left it alone.

264
00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:08.934
No.

265
00:16:09.002 --> 00:16:10.869
They'll take everything
from you if you do that.

266
00:16:10.936 --> 00:16:12.771
All the crazy shit
out there.

What is it?

271
00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:31.224
Take it.

272
00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:33.226
It's for you.

Otherwise,
you're gonna get fucked.

Randall,

277
00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:48.874
I'm not supposed to
have a gun.

Don't sweat it, Art.

279

No one
has to know.

280
00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:56.383
And you can pay me
back some other time.

see you in his office.

Hey, Gary.
You know what I've always wondered?

286
00:17:06.426 --> 00:17:07.659
No idea.

287
00:17:07.726 --> 00:17:09.528
Do you people call it
miniature golf

288
00:17:09.595 --> 00:17:11.864
or is it just golf
to you?

289

[Randall and Arthur

Hello, Hoyt.

293
00:17:36.588 --> 00:17:39.059
Gary said you wanted to see me.

294
00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:42.262
How's the comedy career?
Are you a famous stand-up yet?

295
00:17:42.328 --> 00:17:43.562
Not quite.

296
00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:45.664
Just been working
on my material.

297
00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:47.733
No, don't sit.
This'll be quick.

298
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.469
Look,
I like you, Arthur.

299
00:17:49.536 --> 00:17:50.869
You know,
a lot of the guys,

300
00:17:50.936 --> 00:17:52.305
they think you're a freak,
but I like you.

301
00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:55.774
I don't even know
why I like you.

302
00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:58.011
But I got
another complaint.

303
00:17:58.078 --> 00:18:00.979
It's starting to piss me off.
Kenny's Music.

304
00:18:01.047 --> 00:18:02.981
The guy said
you disappeared.

305
00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:04.750
Never even
returned his sign.

306
00:18:05.452 --> 00:18:07.520
Because I got jumped.

307
00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:09.422
Didn't you hear?

308
00:18:09.489 --> 00:18:11.157
For a sign?

309
00:18:11.224 --> 00:18:13.625
That's bullshit.
It doesn't even make sense.

310
00:18:13.692 --> 00:18:15.528
Just get him
his sign back.

311
00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:18.364
He's going out of business,
for God's sake, Arthur.

312
00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.133
Why would
I keep his sign?

313
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.203
How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?

314
00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:26.306
If you don't
return the sign,

315
00:18:26.372 --> 00:18:28.807
I gotta take it
out of your paycheck.

316
00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:30.976
Are we clear?

317
00:18:32.212 --> 00:18:35.081
Listen,
I'm trying to help you.

318
00:18:35.148 --> 00:18:37.383
Okay? And I'll tell you
something else.

319
00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.884
The other guys,

320
00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:40.719
they don't feel comfortable

I'm Detective Garrity.

This is my partner,
Detective Burke.

836
00:56:52.578 --> 00:56:55.515
We had a few questions for
you, but you weren't home,

837
00:56:56.915 --> 00:56:58.518
so we spoke
with your mother.

838
00:57:00.319 --> 00:57:01.320
Oh.

839
00:57:02.255 --> 00:57:03.856
What did you
say to her?

840
00:57:03.922 --> 00:57:04.990
Did you do this?

841
00:57:05.057 --> 00:57:06.559
What? No.

842
00:57:06.626 --> 00:57:08.828
No, no, no.
We just asked her some questions,

843
00:57:08.895 --> 00:57:10.563
and she got hysterical.

844
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:12.298
Hyperventilating,

845
00:57:12.365 --> 00:57:13.733
collapsed and hit
her head pretty hard.

846
00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:16.335
Yeah. The doctor said
she had a stroke.

847
00:57:16.402 --> 00:57:18.905
We're sorry to
hear about that.

848
00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:22.108
But, like I said,
I still have some questions for you.

849
00:57:22.175 --> 00:57:23.376
They're about
the subway killings

850
00:57:23.443 --> 00:57:24.911
that happened
last week.

851
00:57:24.976 --> 00:57:26.312
You've heard about them, right?

852
00:57:26.379 --> 00:57:27.513
Yeah.

853
00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:28.648
It's horrible.

854
00:57:28.714 --> 00:57:30.583
Right.

855
00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:34.020
So, we spoke with your
boss over at Haha's.

856
00:57:34.086 --> 00:57:36.122
He said you were fired
for bringing a gun

857
00:57:36.189 --> 00:57:37.956
into the children's hospital.

858
00:57:39.192 --> 00:57:41.227
- Is that true, Mr. Fleck?
- It was a prop.

859
00:57:41.294 --> 00:57:43.196
It's part
of my act.

860
00:57:43.262 --> 00:57:44.597
I'm a party clown.

861
00:57:44.664 --> 00:57:46.998
All right.
So, why were you fired?

862
00:57:48.034 --> 00:57:49.968
[sighs heavily]

863
00:57:50.036 --> 00:57:52.738
They said
I wasn't funny enough.

864
00:57:52.805 --> 00:57:54.640
Can you imagine that?

865
00:57:54.707 --> 00:57:58.644
If you don't mind,
I have to go take care of my mother.

866
00:57:58.711 --> 00:58:01.314
[Burke] Your boss also
gave us one of your cards.

867
00:58:03.282 --> 00:58:05.751
This condition of yours,
the laughing,

868
00:58:06.552 --> 00:58:07.887
is it real,

869
00:58:07.954 --> 00:58:10.189
or some sort
of clown thing?

870
00:58:10.256 --> 00:58:13.125
- A clown thing?
- Yeah.

871
00:58:13.192 --> 00:58:15.628
I mean, is it part of your act?

872
00:58:18.097 --> 00:58:19.565
What do you think?

873

[Burke] It's exit only.

She's gonna be okay.

- Yes.

I'm sorry
I just showed up.

But my mother
told me everything,

975
01:05:48.214 --> 01:05:49.815
and I had
to talk to you.

976
01:05:49.882 --> 01:05:52.451
Look, pal,
I'm not your father.

[chuckling]
What's wrong with you?

Look at us.

979
01:05:58.657 --> 01:06:00.126
I think you are.

980
01:06:00.193 --> 01:06:01.760
Well, that's impossible

981
01:06:01.827 --> 01:06:03.029
because you're adopted,

982
01:06:03.096 --> 01:06:04.797
and I never slept with
your mother.

983
01:06:04.863 --> 01:06:05.931
- I wasn't adopted.
- What do you want from me?

984
01:06:05.998 --> 01:06:07.499
- Money?
- No, I don't...

985
01:06:07.566 --> 01:06:08.734
I wasn't adopted.

986
01:06:08.801 --> 01:06:10.903
Jesus.
She never told you?

987
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:12.538
Told me what?

988
01:06:12.604 --> 01:06:14.274
[sighs]

989
01:06:14.341 --> 01:06:15.908
Your mother adopted you
while she was working for us.

990
01:06:15.975 --> 01:06:17.509
That's not true.

991
01:06:17.576 --> 01:06:18.811
Why are you
saying that?

992
01:06:18.877 --> 01:06:19.745
Then she was arrested
and committed

993
01:06:19.812 --> 01:06:20.980
to Arkham State Hospital,

994
01:06:21.047 --> 01:06:22.614
when you were
just a little boy.

995
01:06:22.681 --> 01:06:23.882
Why are you
saying this?

996
01:06:23.949 --> 01:06:25.584
I don't need you to
tell me lies.

997
01:06:25.651 --> 01:06:26.952
I know
it seems strange.

998
01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:28.754
I don't mean to
make you uncomfortable.

999
01:06:28.821 --> 01:06:30.556
I don't know why
everyone is so rude.

1000
01:06:30.622 --> 01:06:31.857
I don't know
why you are.

1001
01:06:31.924 --> 01:06:33.393
I don't want
anything from you.

1002
01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:35.894
Maybe a little bit of
warmth, maybe a hug, Dad!

1003
01:06:35.961 --> 01:06:38.231
How about just a little
bit of fucking decency?

1004
01:06:38.298 --> 01:06:39.665
What is it
with you people?

1005
01:06:39.732 --> 01:06:41.967
You say that stuff
about my mother.

1006
01:06:42.035 --> 01:06:43.336
She's crazy.

1007

She's... [laughing]

1008
01:06:52.945 --> 01:06:54.646
You think
this is funny?

1009

[sighs] Man,
I'm sorry about that, my man.

All records 10 years or older,
they store in the basement,

1057
01:10:33.666 --> 01:10:37.070
and you're talking about
something 30 years ago, so...

1058
01:10:38.171 --> 01:10:40.406
Can I ask you
a question?

1059
01:10:40.473 --> 01:10:42.041
Sure.

1060
01:10:42.108 --> 01:10:47.046
How does someone
wind up in here?

1061

Have they all,
all the people committed crimes?

1062

Well, yeah, some have.

1063
01:10:53.086 --> 01:10:56.055
You know,
some are just crazy.

Pose dangers to

- Yeah. I hear you, brother.
- Hmm.

Sometimes,
I don't know what to do.

Last time, I ended up taking
it out on some people.

me, but it really hasn't.

Like a clerk,
you know.

1079
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:46.139
All I do
is file paperwork.

1080
01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.874
I don't know
what to tell you.

1081
01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:50.842
But you should
see somebody.

1082
01:11:50.909 --> 01:11:52.111
You know,
they got programs,

1083

stuff like that.

1084

Let's see.

Dr. Benjamin Stoner.

Oh. "The patient suffers

01:12:39.292 --> 01:12:41.060

she's your mother.

1096
01:12:45.832 --> 01:12:47.567
Uh...

1097
01:12:47.633 --> 01:12:49.669
I'm sorry, man. Like I said,
I can't release these records,

1098
01:12:49.736 --> 01:12:52.839
you know,
without proper forms.

1099
01:12:52.904 --> 01:12:55.208
I could
get in trouble.

1100
01:12:55.274 --> 01:12:57.577
Look, if you want to bring
your mom in here to sign,

1101
01:12:57.643 --> 01:12:59.278
that'll be much easier,

1102
01:12:59.345 --> 01:13:01.880
but I can't let this go
without her signature, okay?

1103
01:13:01.947 --> 01:13:03.149
I'm sorry.

1104
01:13:07.086 --> 01:13:09.856
No, man! Shit!

01:39:21.727 --> 01:39:23.595

one of us.

1436
01:39:30.469 --> 01:39:32.671
So, can you tell us
about this look?

1437
01:39:32.738 --> 01:39:34.374
When we spoke earlier,

1438
01:39:34.441 --> 01:39:36.309
you mentioned that this look
is not a political statement.

1439
01:39:36.376 --> 01:39:37.609
Is that right?

1440
01:39:37.676 --> 01:39:39.112
That's right, Murray.
I'm not political.

1441
01:39:39.179 --> 01:39:41.880
I'm just trying to
make people laugh.

1442
01:39:41.947 --> 01:39:44.150
- And how's that going for you?

you're a comedian.

1445
01:39:54.027 --> 01:39:55.894
You been working on
any new material?

1446
01:39:55.961 --> 01:39:57.263

tell us a joke?

A book of jokes.

1453
01:40:26.892 --> 01:40:28.660

We got all night.

Okay, okay.
Here's one.

1457
01:40:39.772 --> 01:40:42.442
Knock, knock.

1458
01:40:42.509 --> 01:40:43.976
And you had to
look that up?

1459

01:40:54.454 --> 01:40:56.156
Knock, knock.

1463
01:40:56.222 --> 01:40:57.823
Who's there?

1464
01:40:58.991 --> 01:41:00.592
It's the police, ma'am.

1465
01:41:00.659 --> 01:41:02.594
Your son's been hit
by a drunk driver.

- Oh, no, no, no.

1469
01:41:08.734 --> 01:41:10.602
No, you cannot
joke about that.

1470
01:41:10.669 --> 01:41:12.505
Yeah, that's
not funny, Arthur.

1471
01:41:12.571 --> 01:41:15.741
That's not that kind of
humor we do on this show.

1472
01:41:15.808 --> 01:41:18.111
Okay. I'm...
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1473
01:41:18.178 --> 01:41:22.681
It's just, you know,
it's been a rough few weeks, Murray.

1474
01:41:22.748 --> 01:41:24.284
[chuckling]

1475
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:26.219
Ever since

1476
01:41:28.455 --> 01:41:31.024
I killed those three
Wall Street guys.

1477
01:41:31.091 --> 01:41:32.225
[all gasp]

1478
01:41:37.230 --> 01:41:39.598
Okay, I'm waiting
for the punch line.

1479
01:41:40.799 --> 01:41:42.768
There is
no punch line.

1480
01:41:43.902 --> 01:41:46.005
- It's not a joke.
- [audience murmuring]

1481
01:41:50.543 --> 01:41:51.677
You're serious,
aren't you?

1482
01:41:51.743 --> 01:41:52.978
You're telling us
you killed

1483
01:41:53.046 --> 01:41:54.180
those three young men
on the subway?

1484
01:41:54.247 --> 01:41:55.181
[Arthur] Mmm-hmm.

1485
01:41:55.248 --> 01:41:57.016
And why should
we believe you?

1486
01:41:57.083 --> 01:41:59.252
I got nothing
left to lose.

1487
01:42:01.054 --> 01:42:03.289
Nothing can
hurt me anymore.

1488
01:42:05.091 --> 01:42:06.159
[laughs]

1489
01:42:06.226 --> 01:42:09.728
My life is
nothing but a comedy.

1490
01:42:09.795 --> 01:42:11.730
[audience booing]

1491
01:42:12.831 --> 01:42:14.167
Well, let me
get this straight,

1492
01:42:14.234 --> 01:42:16.336
you think that killing
those guys is funny?

1493
01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:18.338
I do.

1494
01:42:18.404 --> 01:42:21.174
And I'm tired of
pretending it's not.

1495
01:42:21.241 --> 01:42:23.642
Comedy is subjective,
Murray.

1496
01:42:23.709 --> 01:42:25.545
Isn't that
what they say?

1497
01:42:25.612 --> 01:42:27.480
All of you,

1498
01:42:27.547 --> 01:42:30.083
the system
that knows so much,

1499
01:42:30.150 --> 01:42:32.985
you decide
what's right or wrong.

1500
01:42:33.052 --> 01:42:38.424
The same way that you
decide what's funny or not!

1501
01:42:39.691 --> 01:42:41.227
[man] Get him off!

1502
01:42:41.294 --> 01:42:45.265
Well, okay,
I think I might understand

1503
01:42:45.331 --> 01:42:46.899
that you did this to
start a movement,

1504
01:42:46.965 --> 01:42:49.602
to become a symbol?

1505
01:42:49.668 --> 01:42:51.171
Come on, Murray.

1506
01:42:51.237 --> 01:42:52.572
Do I look like
the kind of clown

1507
01:42:52.639 --> 01:42:54.174
that could
start a movement?

1508
01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:57.177
I killed those guys
because they were awful.

1509
01:42:57.243 --> 01:42:59.912
Everybody is awful
these days.

1510
01:42:59.978 --> 01:43:02.282
It's enough to
make anyone crazy.

1511
01:43:02.348 --> 01:43:04.217
[Murray] Okay.
So, that's it, you're crazy.

1512
01:43:04.284 --> 01:43:06.919
That's your defense for
killing three young men?

1513
01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:08.954
No.

1514
01:43:09.022 --> 01:43:12.691
They couldn't carry a
tune to save their lives.

1515
01:43:12.758 --> 01:43:14.160
[audience booing]

1516
01:43:14.227 --> 01:43:18.331
Oh, why is everybody so
upset about these guys?

1517
01:43:18.398 --> 01:43:20.166
If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,

1518
01:43:20.233 --> 01:43:21.800
you'd walk
right over me!

1519
01:43:21.867 --> 01:43:24.037
I pass you every day,
and you don't notice me.

1520
01:43:24.103 --> 01:43:26.306
But these guys, what,
because Thomas Wayne

1521
01:43:26.372 --> 01:43:28.074
went and cried about them on TV?

1522
01:43:28.141 --> 01:43:30.443
You have a problem
with Thomas Wayne, too?

1523
01:43:30.510 --> 01:43:32.312
Yes, I do.

1524
01:43:32.378 --> 01:43:35.981
Have you seen what it's
like out there, Murray?

1525
01:43:36.049 --> 01:43:39.152
Do you ever actually
leave the studio?

1526
01:43:39.219 --> 01:43:43.356
Everybody just yells and
screams at each other.

1527
01:43:43.423 --> 01:43:45.425
Nobody's civil anymore.

1528
01:43:45.491 --> 01:43:49.928
Nobody thinks what it's
like to be the other guy.

1529
01:43:49.995 --> 01:43:52.831
You think men like
Thomas Wayne ever think

1530
01:43:52.898 --> 01:43:54.933
what it's like to be
someone like me?

1531
01:43:55.001 --> 01:43:57.869
To be somebody but themselves?
They don't.

1532
01:43:57.936 --> 01:44:00.039
They think that
we'll just sit there

1533
01:44:00.106 --> 01:44:02.774
and take it,
like good little boys!

1534
01:44:02.841 --> 01:44:05.178
That we won't werewolf
and go wild!

1535
01:44:05.245 --> 01:44:06.613
You finished?

1536
01:44:06.679 --> 01:44:09.215
I mean, it's so much
self-pity, Arthur.

1537
01:44:09.282 --> 01:44:10.916
You sound like
you're making excuses

1538
01:44:10.983 --> 01:44:12.385
for killing
those young men.

1539
01:44:12.452 --> 01:44:14.520
Not everybody,
and I'll tell you this,

1540
01:44:14.587 --> 01:44:16.122
not everyone is awful.

1541
01:44:18.157 --> 01:44:19.592
You're awful, Murray.

1542
01:44:19.659 --> 01:44:21.628
Me? I'm awful?

1543
01:44:21.694 --> 01:44:23.496
Oh, yeah,
how am I awful?

1544
01:44:25.632 --> 01:44:27.200
Playing my video.

1545
01:44:28.334 --> 01:44:31.237
Inviting me
on this show.

1546
01:44:31.304 --> 01:44:34.707
You just wanted to
make fun of me.

1547
01:44:34.773 --> 01:44:36.609
You're just like
the rest of them.

1548
01:44:36.676 --> 01:44:38.678
You don't know the first
thing about me, pal.

1549
01:44:38.745 --> 01:44:41.681
Look what happened,
because of what you did. What it led to.

1550
01:44:41.748 --> 01:44:43.383
There are riots
out there.

1551
01:44:43.449 --> 01:44:45.018
Two policemen are
in critical condition,

1552

You're laughing.

1554
01:44:48.054 --> 01:44:50.590
Someone was killed today,
because of what you did.

1555
01:44:50.657 --> 01:44:52.225
I know.

1556
01:44:54.494 --> 01:44:56.062
How about another joke, Murray?

1557
01:44:56.129 --> 01:44:57.764
No, I think we've had
enough of your jokes.

1558
01:44:57.863 --> 01:44:59.065
- What do you get...
- I don't think so.

1559
01:44:59.132 --> 01:45:01.833

1562
01:45:05.672 --> 01:45:07.140
Call the police, Gene!

1563
01:45:07.206 --> 01:45:08.374
- I'll tell you what you get!
- Call the police.

1564
01:45:08.441 --> 01:45:10.109
You get what you
fucking deserve!
